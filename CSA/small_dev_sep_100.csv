brokers or anyone in the real estate chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate united states laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the note holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the mortgage crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the real estate market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.<sep>  while such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.<sep>  the market relied heavily on consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the usa government provided justice

additionally modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the real estate chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate united states laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the note holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the mortgage crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the real estate market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.<sep>  while such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.<sep>  the market relied heavily on consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the usa government provided justice through president obamas inception and irs inception of modifications which addressed these unethical profits in

"the teddy roosevelt terrier is a small to medium-sized american hunting terrier.<sep>  lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the american rat terrier.<sep>  there is much diversity in the history of the teddy roosevelt terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the american rat terrier, fox paulistinha and tenterfield terrier.<sep>  it is said the rat terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early english and other working class immigrants.<sep>  since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.<sep>  it is assumed that the feist (dog), bull terrier, smooth fox terrier, manchester terrier, whippet, italian greyhound, the now extinct english white terrier, turnspit dog and or wry legged terrier all share in the teddy roosevelt terrier's ancestry.<sep>  these early ratting terriers were then most likely bred to the beagle or beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.<sep>  maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern teddy roosevelt terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.<sep>  although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.<sep> the manchester terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type.<sep> a feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the united states by english miners and other working class immigrants.<sep>  these terriers probably included crosses between the smooth fox terrier, the manchester terrier and the now extinct english white terrier.<sep>  these dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.<sep>  some of these dogs have been crossed with whippets or italian greyhounds (for speed) and beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or rat terrier.<sep> the english setter is a medium size breed of dog.<sep>  it is part of the setter family, which includes the red irish setters, irish red and white setters, and black-and-tan gordon setters.<sep>  the mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail.<sep>  the coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.<sep> the russian toy (also known as the russian toy terrier, and in russia as the russkiy toy, toychik,russian: русский той, тойчик ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in russia from the english toy terrier which is known today as the manchester terrier.<sep>  there are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat.<sep>  the smooth-coated variety was previously known as the russian toy terrier and long-coated as the moscow long haired toy terrier.<sep>  both were brought together under the same russian toy terrier name in 1988 and the ""terrier"" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the fédération cynologique internationale and has been registered in the foundation stock service of the american kennel club since 2008, allowed to compete in akc companion events since 2010.<sep>  the first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in russia.<sep> the viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings.<sep>  frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly.<sep>  frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings.<sep>  viols first appeared in spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the renaissance and baroque (1600-1750) periods.<sep>  early ancestors include the arabic ""rebab"" and the medieval european vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the venetian ""viole"" and the 15th- and 16th-century

of collies have a very strong herding instinct.<sep>  collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially australia and north america) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.<sep>  some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.<sep>  while the akc has a breed they call ""collie"", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.<sep>  there are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.<sep>  they typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity.<sep> the scotch collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of scotland.<sep>  the breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as rough) collie and the short-haired (now known as smooth) collie.<sep>  it is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the roman occupation, which may have included roman cattle dogs, native celtic dogs and viking herding spitzes.<sep>  other ancestors include the gordon and irish setters.<sep> the toy manchester terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier.<sep>  the breed was bred down in size in north america from the manchester terrier, and is placed in the toy group by the american kennel club and

amharic translated: adowa, or sometimes by the italian name ""adua"") was fought on 2 march 1896/yekatit 23, 1889 according to ethiopian calendar between the ethiopian empire and the kingdom of italy near the town of adwa, ethiopia, in tigray.<sep>  this climactic battle of the first italo-ethiopian war, was a decisive defeat for italy and secured ethiopian sovereignty.<sep> p'ent'ay (from amharic: , also transliterated as pentay or pente) is an amharic and tigrinya language term for a christian of a protestant denomination, widely used in ethiopia and among ethiopians and eritreans living abroad.<sep>  the term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the pentecostal experience.<sep>  today, it is used to describe local protestant christians who are not members of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo and eritrean orthodox tewahedo churches.<sep>  the term ""p'ent'ay"" is a shortening of the word ""pentecostal""; however, it is widely used when referring to all protestant christians whether they are actual pentecostals or not.<sep>  some orthodox will also apply the term to the small catholic population of ethiopia.<sep>  the equivalent rendition in many other languages is evangelicals.<sep>  the four major evangelical denominations in ethiopia are: the kale heywet (word of life); mekane yesus (place of jesus), lutheran; mulu wongel (full gospel) and meserete kristos (meaning ""christ foundation"") or mennonite.<sep>  some p'ent'ay communities - especially mekane yesus - have been influenced by the orthodox tewahedo church, which represents mainstream, traditional ethiopian christianity.<sep>  but for the most part they are very pentecostal in their worship and theology.<sep> giuseppe edoardo arimondi, osml, oms, oci (savigliano, 26 april 1846 – adwa, 1 march 1896) was an italian general, mostly known for his role during the first italo-ethiopian war.<sep>  he was one of the few european commanders who gained a victory over the mahdists before kitchener's expedition, soundly defeating them at agordat in 1893.<sep>  after a long and successfull colonial service, he died in combat at adwa, and was posthumously awarded the gold medal of military valor.<sep> the second battle of agordat was fought in late december 1893, between italian colonial troops and mahdists from the sudan.<sep>  emir ahmed ali campaigned against the italian forces in eastern sudan and led about 10–12,000 men east from kassala.<sep>  this force encountered 2,400 italians and their eritrean askaris at agordat, west of asmara, commanded by colonel arimondi.<sep>  over 1,000 dervishes, including the emir, were killed in severe fighting.<sep>  the outcome of the battle constituted:<sep> the treaty of addis ababa, signed 23 october 1896, formally ended the first italo–ethiopian war on terms mostly favorable to ethiopia.<sep>  this treaty superseded a secret agreement between ethiopia and italy negotiated days after the decisive battle of adwa in march of the same year, in which ethiopian forces commanded by menelik ii defeated the italians.<sep>  the most important concession the italians made was the abrogation of the treaty of wuchale and recognizing ethiopia as an independent country.<sep> ",the battle in which giuseppe arimondi lost his life secured what for ethiopia?," After a long and successfull colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.<sep>  This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.<sep> ","42,30"
